                    Freedom fighters are people who fought to free their country from an oppressor.
                    They often face hardships in the process of securing the freedom of their country and people.
                    Because of the freedom fighters who fought for Indian independence,we celebrate Independence Day on August 15 every year.<br>
                    The Indian freedom fighters did not only play an essential  part in the country's independence,
                    but they also left a legacy of daring,unwavering resolve,and steadfast devotion to the country.
                    They inspire millions to fight and preserve our precious freedom,even after their death.

                family's history and nationalism until his death. In 1928,he was implicated in a plan to kill James Scott,
                a British police superintendent,in retaliation for the death of Lala lajpat Rai.<br>
